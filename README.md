# FlareGami
## Project Idea
This is a project to create 3d models through code.

Using Rust.

The idea is twofold. The project name is the idea of two forces working together. Building up layers and combining design seamlessly. Which I will clarify when my idea has more iterations to polish and refine the idea.
